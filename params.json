{"name":"oracle-java7","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nJava 7 packages for Debian.\r\n\r\n### Supported Debian versions\r\n\r\nSo far packages were tested on following Debian versions:\r\n\r\n* wheezy i386/amd64\r\n* squeeze i386/amd64\r\n* lenny i386/amd64\r\n\r\nNew users of Debian Wheezy should cosider using [java-package](http://wiki.debian.org/JavaPackage).\r\n\r\nPackages are compatible with \"official\" Debian ones of Java 6, but\r\nhave a lower priority (use update-java-alternatives if you have Java 6\r\nalready installed).\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nTo create packages on your own:\r\n\r\n* apt-get install dpkg-dev\r\n* git clone git://github.com/rraptorr/oracle-java7.git\r\n* cd oracle-java7\r\n* download jdk-7u4-linux-i586.tar.gz and jdk-7u4-linux-x64.tar.gz from\r\n  [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\r\n  (yes, both, no matter which version you will run)\r\n* dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -us\r\n* install any missing packages that dpkg-buildpackage complains about\r\n  and repeat\r\n\r\n### Legal\r\n\r\nOracle does not permit to distribute repackaged binaries of Java, so\r\nbe advised that hosting any public repository with Java packages is\r\nprobably illegal (at least in some parts of the world).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this repository contains only scripts, that allows\r\none to repackage Oracle Java in Debian friendly way. No binaries are\r\nor will be hosted.","tagline":"Up-to-date Java 7 packages for Debian","google":"UA-3445568-2","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
